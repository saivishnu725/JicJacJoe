a  TicTacToe game using Java

# explanation

Nothing to explain here. It is a TicTacToe game for the console.

# features

* the game obviously!
* clear screen after every attempt (not default)
* the second player wins by default if no games are played (it is definitely "NOT" a bug. it is a feature. I REPEAT. THIS IS NOT A BUG)

# excuse

I didn't do the GUI version because all the Java GUI libraries have ugly UI
